	<p>Electronic Arts - The Sims 4</p>
	<p class="small_text">
		Starting in 2013, I had the amazing opportunity to help bring the Sims 4 to the world!!
		<br>
		At the heart of Silicon Valley at Electronic Arts headquarters in Redwood Shores, just walking through those glass doors into that singular, sprawling, epically grand entrance instantly gave you that surreal 'today is my day!' feeling.  Unforgettable.
		Working with an awesomely talented and inspiring group of (over 300!) people, and as one of less than a dozen User Interface Engineers, I had the good fortune to write code that runs in every single game state!
		<br>
		Muahahahaaa!!
		<br>
		Here's some stuff I helped bring to life that might make you wanna WooHoo.  <i>Awww Yibbbss!!</i>
