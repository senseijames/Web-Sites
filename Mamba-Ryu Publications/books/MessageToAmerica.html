        "There is also ‘us’ – ‘we,' ‘our’ – in reference to my people. I am an ethnically and
racially diverse person. My people are Black Americans; we survived the Middle
Passage, slavery, reconstruction, the Black Codes, the KKK, public lynchings,
mutilations, and the old and the New Jim Crow. My people are Jewish; we survived
the Spanish Inquisition, the European pogroms, and the Nazi concentration camps.
My people are Native Americans; we survived the Trail of Tears and the mass
genocide and dispossession of British-American colonization. My people are
Hispanic; we survived famine, untold violence and social repression promoted by
Spanish colonialism, American imperialism, and fascist dictatorships sponsored and
supported by American foreign policy. We are a diverse group, but we have
something in common: no matter how we arrived here, regardless of our present
circumstances, we have no other place to go. America is the ‘last stop’ for us – which
means our backs are up against the proverbial wall. Keep that image in mind, for
when your back is against the wall, it means that you have nowhere to go but forward
– by whatever means necessary. And in doing so, you have nothing to lose and
everything to gain. ‘We’ will not sit idly by and allow the dark side of our respective
histories to repeat themselves."
        <br><br>
